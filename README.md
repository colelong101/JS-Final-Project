# JS-Final-Project

This is the final project for my Intro to JavaScript class. It is a simple web application that fetches data from the PokeAPI, and allows the user to select the desired Pokemon, and view the important information about it! The Pokemon are stored in an easy to use dropdown menu that allows for some consolidation within the page, and can easily navigate the large amount of Generation 1 Pokemon there are to fetch!
